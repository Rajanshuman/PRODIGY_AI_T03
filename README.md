A Markov chain is a mathematical system usually defined as a collection of random variables, that transition from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. These set of transition satisfies the Markov Property, which states that the probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the current state and time elapsed, and not on the sequence of state that preceded it. This unique characteristic of Markov processes render them memoryless.
A Markov chain is a random process with the Markov property. A random process or often called stochastic property is a mathematical object defined as a collection of random variables. A Markov chain has either discrete state space (set of possible values of the random variables) or discrete index set (often representing time) - given the fact, many variations for a Markov chain exists. Usually the term "Markov chain" is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is a Discrete Time Markov chain (DTMC).

Let's try to code the example above in Python. And although in real life, you would probably use a library that encodes Markov Chains in a much efficient manner, the code should help you get started...
